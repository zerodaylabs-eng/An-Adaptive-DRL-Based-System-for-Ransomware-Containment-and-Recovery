# An-Adaptive-DRL-Based-System-for-Ransomware-Containment-and-Recovery
This project explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning to model ransomware response as a sequential decision-making problem. The system operates in a simulated environment and is currently a research prototype. Detection and recovery modules are experimental and not fully functional or production-ready.
